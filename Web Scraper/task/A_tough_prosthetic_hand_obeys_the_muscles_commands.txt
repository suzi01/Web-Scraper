Article Content :A lightweight prosthetic hand can grasp strawberries without crushing them and still works after being hit with a hammer or run over by a 1.5-tonne vehicle.Xiangyang Zhu at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China and his colleagues developed the resilient prosthesis for people with amputations below the elbow. The device boasts a 3D-printed palm and five jointed digits containing silicone tubes that are moved with pressurized air. Electrical signals from forearm muscles control the hand, which has five configurations.Other prosthetic hands controlled through nervous-system signals can cost more than US$10,000. The components used in the team’s version cost less than $500. The hand is also considerably more lightweight than its competitors, thanks to a bag worn at the waist that contains the battery and the electronics used to turn the arm’s signals into movement instructions. The bag also carries the pumps and valves used to supply air.Study participants needed just 15 minutes to learn how to control the prosthesis, which provides feedback using signals sent from pressure-sensitive sensors on the fingertips to electrodes on the upper arm.
