Article Content :Phillip Island centipedes can reach nearly 25 centimetres long, and have an appetite to match their size: those living on their namesake island together kill and eat as many as 3,700 seabird chicks each year.The centipedes (Cormocephalus coynei), which immobilize their prey with a potent venom, live only on Phillip and Nepean islands, some 1,400 kilometres east of Australia. Luke Halpin at Monash University in Clayton, Australia, and his colleagues studied the feeding habits of these centipedes on Phillip Island and monitored the chicks of the black-winged petrel (Pterodroma nigripennis), which nests there.In typical island ecosystems, seabirds sit near the top of the food chain. But the researchers captured video of centipedes attacking and feeding on petrel chicks. The team calculated the number of chicks killed by centipedes in part by analysing tissue samples from centipedes and their prey.By preying on animals such as seabirds and by scavenging fish, the centipedes trap marine nutrients and distribute them across the island, giving the creatures a crucial part in the ecosystem, the authors write.
